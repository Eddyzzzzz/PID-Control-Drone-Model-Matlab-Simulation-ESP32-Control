# PID-Controlled Propeller with MATLAB-Tuned Gains and IMU Feedback  

This project involves an ESP32-based PID-controlled propeller balancer, designed as a preparatory step for building a drone. The system utilizes IMU feedback and MATLAB-tuned PID gains to maintain stability.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Program  

1. **Build the Mechanical Structure**  
   - Assemble the hardware components, ensuring proper alignment and secure mounting of the propeller.  

2. **Load the Program**  
   - Open the project in **PlatformIO**.  

3. **Compile and Upload**  
   - Click **Build** to compile the code.  
   - Click **Upload** to flash the ESP32.  
   - Wait for the upload process to complete.  

Once uploaded, the system will begin balancing the propeller using the PID control algorithm.
